# Bike Sharing - Data Analytics Project

This project aims to analyze bicycle rental (bike-sharing) usage patterns based on historical usage data from 2011-2012. The data used includes information such as date, weather, season, number of users, and others. For further information, like the background of dataset, dataset characteristics, label explanation, and more, you can check out the in this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zangetsu21/Bike-Sharing/main/data/Readme.txt). So in here, I won't explain it any further.

Analysis was carried out to understand trends in bicycle use from year to year, patterns of bicycle use between weekdays and weekends, the influence of weather on bicycle use, and trends in bicycle use based on season. This data analysis project dashboard has also been deployed via the Streamlit Cloud Community. If you want to access it, you can use this [link](https://bike-sharing-dashboard-bima.streamlit.app/).
