# Bike Sharing - Data Analytics Project

This project is an analysis of data on the use of bike-sharing (rental) services, which is a form of transportation that is increasingly popular in various countries. In this project, I analyzed bicycle usage data from 2011 to 2012. This data analysis project dashboard has also been deployed via the Streamlit Cloud Community. If you want to access it, you can use this [link](https://bike-sharing-dashboard-bima.streamlit.app/).
